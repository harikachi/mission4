This repo is created to build an Insurance Bot Application using Google Gemini API, using react front end and Node as backend.

There will be two .env files one for react app and one for node.

Make sure to replace the .env_sample file to .env and use appropriate GEMINI_API key and the port numbers.

Once the react and node applications are working use the docker file script to create the containers.
